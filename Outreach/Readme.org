* Spring 2018 Outreach
** We will hold an outreach at the University of North Texas' Discovery Park Campus
   In this event, we will host High School students from Little Elm's Lebano High School
   Our goal is to provide them a hands-on activity that is related to our project.
   By doing this, the students will be able to understan what Computer Engineering is about
   as well as to participate on writing code that will demostrate basic coding syntaxs as well
   and how to compile a basi program.

   We will cover:
   - A Our background as students and chanllenges we have faced during our course.
   - We will talk about the indistry as well as to why we chose Computer Engineering.
   - We will talk about our project and how it will change astronaut's lighting enviroment on deep space missions.
   - And finally, we will guide them on modifying code related to our project.
